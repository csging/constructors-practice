# constructors-practice

various apps used to practice writing constructors. All apps are run with Node in the command Line. The most impressive app would be the toma.js file which is a Tomagatchi clone app about a doggie that you can play with, check his status, and feed. Its pretty cool what you can do with just the command line.
